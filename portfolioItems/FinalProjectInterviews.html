Question 1: What is your opinion on generative AI and art? (ie. Do you think it is good or productive for people?)
                </p>
                <p> 
" I think for artistic purposes there is no reason to use AI. It steals from real artists, recreates work poorly, harms the environment, and negatively impacts artists, writers and musicians when used for those applications."
                </p>
                <p> 
Question 2: Do you think generative AI has a place in artistic fields, if so, where?
                </p>
                <p> 
"In artistic fields, no. I have seen arguments made for is used in medical settings, for things like early cancer detection, if it works, I see no issue using it in that field, it would save lives. However it takes advantage of and opportunities away from artists and has no place in a creative field"
                </p>
                <p> 
Querstion 3: How often are you presented with generative AI of your field of art? What do you think of it?
                </p>
                <p> 
"A lot of places are opening up to using AI to edit, research, and generate ideas, personally I’m against this as it can be, and often is, full of misinformation or outdated data "
                </p>
                <p> 
Question 4: Has generative AI affected the way you present your work? Has it affected the way people view your work?
                </p>
                <p> 
I still write the same and try to write to the best of my ability according to house style, or my own personal style. People are more weary of AI usage, especially with certain punctuation use
                </p>

Question 1: What is your opinion on generative AI and art? (ie. Do you think it is good or productive for people?)
                </p>
                <p> 
"Even when disregarding environmental and moral concerns, I still don’t like AI art. I think that it takes jobs away from real artists, and will likely rob many people of the experience of making art for themselves."
                </p>
                <p> 
Question 2: Do you think generative AI has a place in artistic fields, if so, where?
                </p>
                <p> 
"Many people believe that AI could have a place in artistic fields as something to help brainstorm with, generating rough ideas for a final concept. Although I find this to be the most worthwhile way of using AI in art, I still don’t think it is a good idea. People are always looking for and appreciating unique ideas. This will become especially true as media continues to become overrun with AI unoriginality. All AI can do is take things that already exist and mash them together in an uninspired manner. It can’t have original ideas, and anything it makes has no weight of human experience behind it. How is something that has never had emotions meant to appeal to our own? If an artist needs help with ideas for a piece, I think there are many better ways of finding them than using AI. AI might be the easier answer, but it will likely lead to an uninspired copy of a final piece."

Querstion 3: How often are you presented with generative AI of your field of art? What do you think of it?
                </p>
                <p> 
"Being both an artist and a programmer means that AI is shoved down my throat constantly. I have had multiple professors recommend using AI which is absurd to me—why even bother paying for school if you’re just going to have AI do all of the work for you? "
                </p>
                <p> 
Question 4: Has generative AI affected the way you present your work? Has it affected the way people view your work?
                </p>
                <p> 
"AI has made me more diligent about crediting myself for any visual artworks I include in games or projects. I haven’t had anyone say anything about my work in regard to AI, but I’m sure AI art as a whole makes many people find human-made art less impressive."
                </p>

                <h2>Elliott Monteith, musician</h2>
                <p> 
Question 1: What is your opinion on generative AI and art? (ie. Do you think it is good or productive for people?)
                </p>
                <p> 
"I think generative AI is entirely too unoriginal and destructive to the world of art,
especially in mediums like visual art and music. To me, the concept of using something like a
generative AI program to create ideas for you is entirely dystopian; the sheer amount of
originality one must lack to decide that rather than trying to find inspiration through the
world, whether it be nature, movies and television, music, literally anything is so absurd. In
terms of allowing people to start the creative process, I still think it is overall terrible for
productivity as it doesn’t create anything original, it just steals from other artists who have put
years into their craft, just for some fatsuit C.E.O. to give the go ahead to fatten their pockets.
I am very against AI as an artistic “tool”, if you need it to create something then I think you
shouldn’t be in an artistic field, try accounting.

                <p> 
Question 2: Do you think generative AI has a place in artistic fields, if so, where?
                </p>
                <p> 
"I think AI should stay far, far away from any realm of art. The whole purpose of art is
an expression of the experience of being a human, art has always relied on lived experiences.
This is why when art is created by someone trying to cash in on the latest trend they always
get called out for their inauthenticity, so the thought of even arguing to have something so
unoriginal and inauthentic as artificial “intelligence” in the arts is plain laughable. Sure it can
“create” “art”, but it will always be terrible and stolen, a mere amalgamation of whatever it’s
stolen and decided to churn out. As for the argument of it allowing those with disabilities to
create art, that’s an awful ableist argument, as it not only assumes that people with disabilities
are incapable of creating art but that they need such a large crutch to do so, I mean there are
plenty of incredible artists who have disabilities and have been making art for decades at this
point, I mean hell, Beethoven was deaf and created Sonatas that are still widely known and
relevant today in the world of classical music, and Def Leppard’s drummer has been an
amputee since the 80’s and still absolutely rips!

Querstion 3: How often are you presented with generative AI of your field of art? What do you think of it?
                </p>
                <p> 
"I am thankfully not often presented with AI in my field due to my obvious moral
qualms with the usage of generative AI, but when I am I denounce it entirely. The last time
someone told me about a song they generated with ChatGPT I told them that it was
absolutely pathetic that they did that, and that they’re entirely capable of sitting down for five
minutes and looking up chords and making an arrangement that way, and if not then they
should practise more or learn music theory.

Question 4: Has generative AI affected the way you present your work? Has it affected the way people view your work?
                </p>
                <p> 
" It hasn’t at all affected the way I present my work or how people view it in my
opinion, I am very vocally anti AI and it shows in my work. Ai is terrible at making anything
other than generic pop music so my styling of noisy rock music has yet to be affected by the
detrimental usage of AI, since most people who create things similar to me are also anti AI
and denounce those who use it.
