                <h2>Visualization Critique</h2>
                <p>My infographic compares fairly well against those discussed in class. The data is displayed clearly and the written information is brief and easy for a viewer to consume. 
                    There was no information that I found to be missing; However, it was difficult to find the total percent employment of women because most studies reported on the percent 
                    increase or decrease of employment statistics and didn’t mention the actual full percent, which made the data useless for my visualisation. 

                </p>
                <p>I learned that the way that infographics convey information is much more purposeful in what opinions the infographic is pushing with the data. 
                    An agenda is clearly in mind during the full creation process of the infographic. I see infographics much differently 
                    now that I have made one in this way since I now understand the extent of the biases that are embedded in a data visualisation. 
                    In the future I will be more conscious of what I am really looking at when viewing a data visualisation. 

                </p>
                <p>The biases in infographics could be seen as a problem in terms of the infographic being a purely informal tool;
                    However, it is worth considering that infographics may be a persuasive tool that allows the creator to make a visualisation that expresses their opinion with the data to back it up.
                    Infographics are an excellent tool because they can help people easily digest information as interpreted by various views and compare them against one another. 
                    A good infographic will convince its viewer of the author’s opinion.
