                <p>
 One of the most relevant topics in online media today is generative artificial Intelligence (AI). It has become easier to find content generated by AI on the internet and to access free AI software. This generated content has come to be known colloquially as AI “art.” Alongside generative AI comes a variety of issues affecting real artists, and their audiences; but how harmful is AI “art” to society? 

                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that art, in this context, is defined as “A practical application of knowledge; (hence) something which can be achieved or understood by the employment of skill and knowledge”[Art]. Because AI “art” requires no such application of knowledge, AI “art” will be exclusively written in scare quotes. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    For society as a whole, the issues presented by generative AI, or AI “art” can be broken up into several categories: Environmental, legal, cognitive and social issues. Each of these categories provide a unique method of harming  society and each must be considered. 

                </p>

                <p>
 AI “art” presents an extremely problematic influence on the environment. Generative AI data centres consume an extremely high amount of energy. For an AI company like Stable Diffusion, “Estimated impact values are significant. Supporting one year of Stable Diffusion service for the observed number of users can generate as much as 360 tons of CO² equivalent” [Berthelot]. Data centres don’t just consume energy, they also consume water for cooling purposes, “A small 1 MW data centre using one of these types of traditional cooling can use around 25.5 million litres of water per year”[Mytton]. With such a large intake of energy and water, especially in the current climate crisis, it is not worth setting up AI data centre infrastructure as it will only accelerate the destruction of the planet, and by extension, society as a whole. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Generative AI also presents legal issues surrounding intellectual property and ownership. Generative AI models function by scraping the internet for reference data and using that data to create content out of parts of each item scraped. These scraped items are used without the consent of the owner and are never credited or acknowledged in the product made by the AI. Although it is common for users prompting generative AI to be denied ownership of the generated content, there are currently no common laws addressing the original creators who were stolen from by the AI algorithm, instead, it is common for the AI itself to be credited as the owner [Kirakosyan]. When ownership and consent is violated, it treats the original creators as lesser and undeserving of consideration or credit. If  companies can find a way around stealing from people by using AI, it becomes a major concern for what else can be circumvented by using AI as a non-human mediator. This is incredibly dangerous to society. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of cognitive impact, generative AI has no doubt found its way into the daily lives of developing youths. Habitual overreliance on generative AI can cause a cognitive decline resulting in limited intellectual performance [Abbosh]. Limited development of cognitive abilities prevents individuals from exercising forms of abstract expression like high level written discussion, artistic expression or musical expression. This cognitive deterioration may result in individuals using generative AI as a crutch, requiring an overreliance on AI to function. AI cannot innovate, therefore: if there is such a heavy reliance on generative AI, there becomes a risk of future generations losing the ability to form unique ideas and opinions, which may result in an overall decline in the critical thinking abilities of new generations.

                </p>
               <p>
                     Social lives in the world are also impacted by Generative AI. Users of AI companions report finding some form of fulfilment from the service, however, “While this can provide short-term comfort, it may hinder the development of skills necessary for navigating the complexities of human relationships”[Savic]. If a person does not learn the necessary skills to interact with real people, it causes individuals to become isolated, interacting only with an AI companion that provides constant gratification and can be tailored specifically to each user to make them feel validated on any opinion they may have regardless of if it is harmful to others. The danger with these AI companions lies in the way that companies set their agenda. They want to make as much money per user as possible and giving users constant praise and assurance keeps them active and profitable for the company. There is little regard for user wellbeing in these business models and this perpetuates a harmful world view onto AI companion users. 

                </p>

                <p>
While the impacts of generative AI, or AI “art,” on general society run deep and affect everyone, it should also be discussed how the actual artists, who are the ones responsible for driving a large part of societal culture, are affected by generative AI.  Artists across three main fields of art were questioned about their feelings and experiences of AI “art” in their specific fields of visual art, written art, and musical art. The first question asked in each interview focused on individual opinions at a broad scale, “What is your opinion on generative AI and art?” Each participant expressed concerns for the environment, ownership of art, and the impact that generative AI has on the livelihood of human artists. Randi Palmer, a Humber College professional writing student and published journalist stated “(AI) steals from real artists, recreates work poorly, harms the environment, and negatively impacts artists, writers and musicians when used for those applications” [Palmer]. Vinny Elliot, graduate of Sheridan College Visual Arts program and current York University Digital Media and Game Design student stated “I still don’t like AI art. I think that it takes jobs away from real artists, and will likely rob many people of the experience of making art for themselves” [Elliot]. Elliot expresses concern for artistic occupations as well as maintaining the human connection to the creation of art. Elliott Monteith, a recording artist, local musician, and sound engineer notably stated, “To me, the concept of using something like a generative AI program to create ideas for you is entirely dystopian”[Monteith]. The concern for the development of AI “art” runs deeper than just statistics and headlines and is a genuine concern on a personal level for real artists. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, each person was asked if they think generative AI has a place in artistic fields. The primary concern presented was that of authenticity and originality in art, Monteith discusses “The whole purpose of art is an expression of the experience of being a human” [Monteith]. The unanimous opinion across each interviewed artist was that AI should have no place in the creative process or actual creation of art. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The third question was related to the experiences that the artists had when presented with AI generated content, each artist was asked “how often are you presented with generative AI of your field of art? What do you think of it?”[Latour]  For this question there was a range of responses. Palmer expressed a form of normalization of AI in writing, “A lot of places are opening up to using AI to edit, research, and generate ideas, personally I’m against this as it can be, and often is, full of misinformation or outdated data“ [Palmer]. Monteith discussed a minimal appearance of AI “art” in music towards them, “I am thankfully not often presented with AI in my field due to my obvious moral qualms with the usage of generative AI” [Monteith]. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Elliot protests that “Being both an artist and a programmer means that AI is shoved down my throat constantly. I have had multiple professors recommend using AI which is absurd to me” [Elliott]. Despite a range of frequency across each artistic field, AI “art” is still present and pushes its way into each creative field against the wishes of artists who are unjustly stolen from to train the AI model. 

                </p>
                <p>
Last, each artist was asked about how their personal work has been affected and if they see that their audience views their work differently due to generative AI. Each artist expressed that they do not let worries of being accused of using AI affect their art. These artists each believed that the work they produce is authentic enough to remove any AI influences from the creative process. If artists are threatened and diminished by generative AI, society risks devaluing innovation, expression and human experience. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the artists themselves have an important role in the relationship between art and society, another major afflicted group of  AI “art” is the audience. The experience of viewing an artwork has now changed drastically from simply being able to look at any creation and enjoy it as the result of human creativity to first needing to assess whether or not the work is created by a human or a computer. The ability of an audience member to spot and deal with AI-generated content has become almost necessary when consuming content on the internet today. There has been a prominent oversaturation of AI generation in content creation which has resulted in a large portion of the internet being AI generated content [Law]. AI “art” has pushed harmful views onto people who view art, “I’m sure AI art as a whole makes many people find human-made art less impressive”  [Elliott]. If people can no longer trust what their eyes are seeing, there will be a constant sense of paranoia and distrust being propagated through society because of AI “art.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea that AI “art” could be devaluing human made art presents a major cultural concern for society. Art is a way for people to share complex emotions and opinions and if that loses its perceived value because a machine can do it faster or more efficiently is an insult to humanity. Hayao Miyazaki, Japanese animator and filmmaker described AI producing art like humans as “an insult to life itself” [Miyazaki]. If nothing is done about the way in which generative AI is polluting the arts, one of the largest parts of society and culture could lose a detrimental amount of perceived value and understanding. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The  research question “How harmful is AI “art” to society?” is answered by breaking down the effects of AI “art” into four categories of environmental, legal, social, and cognitive impacts on society. Each category discusses unique impacts AI “art” has on society and culture. Professional opinions are discussed alongside statistical evidence to demonstrate the severity of generative AI’s impacts.
